# What's in these files

Everything here came from the [official 2026-27 ACT Budget papers](https://www.treasury.act.gov.au/budget/budget-2026-27/budget-papers-and-statements).
Nothing has been edited except format.

## The 13 statements, as markdown

Converted from the official Word versions. Every heading has an HTML anchor, so
you can link a figure straight to the paragraph it came from, the way Budget
Buddy v1 does.

## `source/` : the official spreadsheet & docx statements

`ACT-Government-2026-27-Budget-tables.xlsx` is Treasury's own published
spreadsheet, **65 tables across 14 sheets**, already clean. 
**Check here before you extract anything.**

It covers the Budget Outlook (chapters 1 to 4), including Table 3.3.1 and
Table 3.3.2 on the sheet `Chapter 3.3`.

**It does not repeat Statements A to H, but it does contain whole-of-government
versions of some of their tables.** Which ones, and what each version leaves
out, is in [`CROSSWALK.md`](CROSSWALK.md). Worth two minutes before you extract
anything out of Word.

If you want to access statement docx, they are listed under [`source`]. These are direct uploads from the [Treasury site Budget Papers and Statements page](https://www.treasury.act.gov.au/budget/budget-2026-27/budget-papers-and-statements), easy for you to download. If you want to copy tables straight out of Word (which is
[Route 2](../EXTRACTING-DATA.md)) 

## `extracted/` : pre-extracted CSVs, your safety net

If you get stuck at the data checkpoint, use these and keep building.
See [`extracted/README.md`](extracted/README.md) for row counts and the
reconciliation report for each one.
